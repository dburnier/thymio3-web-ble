Chrome:
pre-requisites:
1) go to chrome://flags and enable Web Bluetooth. Realunch browser
visualize page:
just open the thymio.html with Chrome

If a local web server is needed:
1) go to this directory and run a local http server: python3 -m http.server 8000
2) open link in chrome: http://localhost:8000/thymio_prox.html

Bluefy:
1) install bluefly from the appstore
2) use localsend (installed both on ipad and linux) to easily transfer a python script to the ipad
3) navigate to https://projects.gctronic.com/thymio3/ble/thymio_py.html 
  - I uploaded both thymio_py.html and thymio.global.js in the same folder
Bluefy seems not be able to connect to a local web server using an IP (e.g. http://192.168.1.59:8000/thymio_py.html)
